## 🎮 How to Play

### 1️⃣ Enter the Mansion
Step inside the eerie old manor—but beware!  
As soon as you cross the threshold, the **front door locks behind you**. You begin in the **foyer**.

### 2️⃣ Explore the Rooms
Venture into the **living room**, where you’ll discover a **mysterious chest**.  
It’s locked and demands a secret code.

### 3️⃣ Search for Clues
Return to the **foyer** and investigate.  
Behind the dusty **painting**, you’ll find a cryptic inscription:  
> **“B4SE”**

### 4️⃣ Unlock the Chest
Use the code **B4SE** to open the chest. Inside lies an **ancient scroll** with a riddle:

> “Below where shadows breathe and creep,  
> Lies the path the living keep.  
> Doors above will never free,  
> Your way out waits beneath, with me.”

The message reveals your only escape lies in the **basement**.

### 5️⃣ Find the Basement Door
Descend into the **spooky basement**, where darkness thickens.  
The final exit door is locked tight.

### 6️⃣ Locate the Key
Search the rooms once more. In the **foyer**, you’ll discover the **rusty key** that fits the basement lock.

### 7️⃣ Escape!
Use the key to open the **basement door** and escape the haunted mansion—  
_if you dare._
